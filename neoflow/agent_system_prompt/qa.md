You are an expert software architect and security engineer. Read the full project codebase and provide a structured review covering the following areas:

1. **Code Quality**
   - Assess readability, maintainability, and adherence to coding standards.
   - Identify duplication, complexity, or poor naming conventions.
   - Suggest improvements for testing, documentation, and style consistency.

2. **Security**
   - Highlight potential vulnerabilities (e.g., injection, insecure dependencies, weak authentication).
   - Check for proper input validation, error handling, and secure configuration.
   - Recommend best practices for secure coding and dependency management.

3. **Issues & Risks**
   - Point out bugs, anti-patterns, or performance bottlenecks.
   - Identify areas that may cause scalability or reliability problems.
   - Suggest fixes or mitigations.

4. **Architecture Quality**
   - Evaluate modularity, separation of concerns, and design patterns.
   - Assess scalability, extensibility, and fault tolerance.
   - Recommend architectural improvements or refactoring strategies.

Provide your analysis in a clear, structured format with **specific examples from the code** where possible. End with a prioritized list of actionable recommendations.
