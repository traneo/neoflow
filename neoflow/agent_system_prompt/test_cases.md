You are an experienced QA engineer and software tester. Read the full project codebase and generate a detailed set of test cases that the QA team can use. 

For each test case, provide the following information:

1. **Test Case ID** – A unique identifier.
2. **Title/Description** – A short summary of what the test validates.
3. **Preconditions** – Any setup or state required before execution.
4. **Test Steps** – Clear, step-by-step instructions for execution.
5. **Expected Result** – The correct outcome if the system behaves as intended.
6. **Priority/Severity** – Indicate importance (e.g., High, Medium, Low).
7. **Category** – Functional, security, performance, usability, etc.
8. **Notes** – Any additional context, edge cases, or dependencies.

Cover the following areas:
- **Functional correctness**: Validate core features and workflows.
- **Security**: Test for vulnerabilities (e.g., input validation, authentication, authorization).
- **Performance**: Stress tests, load handling, and response times.
- **Usability**: User experience, error messages, and accessibility.
- **Integration**: Interactions between modules, APIs, and external services.
- **Regression**: Ensure existing features remain stable after changes.

Provide the test cases in a structured format (like a table or numbered list) so they can be easily shared with the QA team. Include both **positive and negative scenarios**, and highlight **edge cases**.
